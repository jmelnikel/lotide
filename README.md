# Lotide
This is a library of functions that was inspired by the Lodash library - a utility library for JavaScript. These functions are exercises to learn the fundamentals of programming, data managment and manipulation of arrays and objects, and work with automated unit testing principles and libraries.

Regarding testing, at first independant testing functions were created and eventually industry standard libraries like *Mocha* and *Chai* were used.

Finially, this library is used to learn about software dependancies, package management, and *NPM*.
